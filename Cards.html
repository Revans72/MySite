                "A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't
                see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars."

                "To better visualize a wormhole, consider the analogy of a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it (to represent two points in space-time), the line between them showing the distance from one point to the other in normal space-time. If the paper
                is now bent and folded over almost double (the equivalent of drastically warping space-time), then poking the pencil through the paper provides a much shorter way of linking the two points, a short-cut through space-time much like a wormhole."

                "White holes are the theoretical opposite of black holes. As black holes draw in surrounding stars, dust, passing spaceships – whatever comes too near – so white holes, by definition, would radiate light. Matter can and would escape from white holes into
                the universe. Both white and black holes were entirely theoretical several decades ago, but now many actual astronomical objects are associated with black holes. Even our home galaxy, the Milky Way, is thought to have a black hole at its
                heart."
